# Scheduler-Simulator-Project

Developed a program to simulate the scheduling of a dual core processor by using multithreading (GNU C Library, Pthreads). 
It simulates the scheduling of a set of tasks with preemptive and not preemptive scheduling.

* Not preemptive algorithm: SPN
* Preemptive algorithm: SRT

Files:
* main
* listmaker
* preemptive
* not_preemptive
